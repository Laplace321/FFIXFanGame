新版本Ver0.11对技能进行如下调整：
Trace on不再消耗TP，而是调整为当TP达到80才能使用，并且当状态开启后使用任何消耗MP的魔法会取消状态；
近战三连的技能现在可以同时出现在技能栏中，并且分别消耗TP，按照123的顺序打出三连可以获得最大的输出，并可以使用赤核爆和赤神圣技能；
因为有了上述的调整，现在再进入近战状态后可以只使用瞬法赤治疗。

Version0.11 Update:
'Trace On' doesn't consume TP anymore, instead of comsuming 80 TP. TP value should reach 80 to meet the casting conditon, and any MP consuming will cancel the effect of the skill.
After casting Trace On, the Battle Skills will show in the skill menu instead of one by one, you can release them at will, but remember that releasing them by order can give higher damage.
Besides, Battle skills will cost TP, and once you release them by order, then you are able to cast the Ultra Black/White Magic.
Based on the above adjustment, it is possible to only cast 'SwiftCast RedHealing' after casting 'Trace On'
